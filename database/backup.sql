INSERT INTO `categories` VALUES (1,'Fruits','In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.\r\nFruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.','https://api.iconify.design/noto-v1/watermelon.svg'),(2,'Herbs','a substance generally derived from flavorful plants that is added to food for the purpose of flavoring food. Seasonings have a wet nature, so they cannot last or be stored for long; it is different with spices which tend to be dry.','https://api.iconify.design/noto/herb.svg'),(3,'Meats','Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.[1] Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged animals for meat since prehistoric times. The establishment of settlements in the Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses.','https://api.iconify.design/noto/cut-of-meat.svg'),(4,'Meals','A meal is an eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes prepared food.[1][2] The names used for specific meals in English vary, depending on the speaker\'s culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. Meals occur primarily at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks.','https://api.iconify.design/emojione-v1/pot-of-food.svg'),(5,'Beverages','A drink (or beverage) is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history','https://api.iconify.design/noto/hot-beverage.svg'),(6,'Vegetables','Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.','https://api.iconify.design/noto/carrot.svg'),(7,'Seafoods','Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans, prominently including fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of molluscs (e.g. bivalve molluscs such as clams, oysters and mussels, and cephalopods such as octopus and squid), crustaceans (e.g. shrimp, crabs, and lobster), and echinoderms (e.g. sea cucumbers and sea urchins). Historically, marine mammals such as cetaceans (whales and dolphins) as well as seals have been eaten as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants such as some seaweeds and microalgae are widely eaten as sea vegetables around the world, especially in Asia.','https://api.iconify.design/noto/crab.svg'),(8,'Groceries','A grocery store (AE), grocery shop (BE) or simply grocery[1] is a store that primarily retails a general range of food products,[2] which may be fresh or packaged. In everyday U.S. usage, however, \"grocery store\" is a synonym for supermarket,[3] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries. In the UK, shops that sell food are distinguished as grocers[3] or grocery shops (though in everyday use, people usually use either the term \"supermarket\" or a \"corner shop\"[4] or \"convenience shop\").','https://api.iconify.design/noto/salt.svg');

Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures. including Norse. Greek. and European Christian tradition.\\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents. and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally. apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree. allowing for easier harvesting.\\nThere are more than 7.500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses. including cooking. eating raw. and cider production.

The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome. and therefore the maternal line. is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China. Northeast India. and Myanmar. and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987. orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh. or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.

The fruit is variable in size. color. and firmness. but is usually elongated and curved. with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind. which may be green. yellow. red. purple. or brown when ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species \\u2013 Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

By contrast. Musa cultivars with firmer. starchier fruit are called \\\"plantains\\\". In other regions. such as Southeast Asia. many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten. so the binary distinction is not as useful and is not made in local languages.\\nThe term \\\"banana\\\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of the genus Musa. such as the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea). the pink banana (Musa velutina). and the Fe\'i bananas.

The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco. meaning \\\"head\\\" or \\\"skull\\\". after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.\\nThe coconut tree provides food. fuel. cosmetics. folk medicine and building materials. among many other uses. The inner flesh of the mature seed. as well as the coconut milk extracted from it. form a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid. called coconut water or coconut juice. Mature. ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds. or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh. charcoal from the hard shell. and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra. and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking \\u2013 frying in particular \\u2013 as well as in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells. fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decoration.\\nThe coconut has cultural and religious significance in certain societies. particularly in the Western Pacific Austronesian cultures where it features in their mythologies. songs. and oral traditions. It also had ceremonial importance in pre-colonial animistic religions. It has also acquired religious significance in South Asian cultures. where it is used in Hindu rituals. It forms the basis of wedding and worship rituals in Hinduism. It also plays a central role in the Coconut Religion of Vietnam. The falling nature of their mature fruit has led to preoccupation with death by coconut.Coconuts were first domesticated by the Austronesian peoples in Island Southeast Asia and were spread during the Neolithic via their seaborne migrations as far east as the Pacific Islands. and as far west as Madagascar and the Comoros. They played a critical role in the long sea voyages of Austronesians by providing a portable source of food and water. as well as providing building materials for Austronesian outrigger boats. Coconuts were also later spread in historic times along the coasts of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans by South Asian. Arab. and European sailors. Coconut populations today can still be divided into two based on these separate introductions - the Pacific coconuts and Indo-Atlantic coconuts. respectively. Coconuts were introduced by Europeans to the Americas only during the colonial era in the Columbian exchange. but there is evidence of a possible pre-Columbian introduction of Pacific coconuts to Panama by Austronesian sailors. The evolutionary origin of the coconut is under dispute. with theories stating that it may have evolved in Asia. South America. or on Pacific islands. Trees grow up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and can yield up to 75 fruits per year. though fewer than 30 is more typical. Plants are intolerant of cold weather and prefer copious precipitation. as well as full sunlight. Many insect pests and diseases affect the species and are a nuisance for commercial production.

This has been confirmed by a panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). which also concludes that a caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day does not raise safety concerns for adults. According to the ESFA this is equivalent to 4 cups of coffee (90 mg each) or 2 1/2 standard cans (250 ml) of energy drink (160 mg each/80 mg per serving).Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar. but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance. such as increased attention and reaction speed. are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.

Peanuts is among the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips. with 17.897 strips published in all. making it \\\"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\\\". At the time of Schulz\'s death in 2000. Peanuts ran in over 2.600 newspapers. with a readership of around 355 million in 75 countries. and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States. and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.Peanuts focuses entirely on a social circle of young children. where adults exist but are never seen and rarely heard. The main character. Charlie Brown. is meek. nervous. and lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite. win a baseball game. or kick a football held by his irascible friend Lucy. who always pulls it away at the last instant. Peanuts is one of the literate strips with philosophical. psychological. and sociological overtones that flourished in the 1950s. Peanuts\'s humor is psychologically complex and driven by the characters\' interactions and relationships.\\nPeanuts achieved considerable success with its television specials. several of which. including A Charlie Brown Christmas and It\'s the Great Pumpkin. Charlie Brown. won or were nominated for Emmy Awards. The Peanuts holiday specials remain popular and had been broadcast on network television for over 50 years before moving to the Apple TV+ streaming service in 2020. In addition. the specials occasionally rerun on PBS and PBS Kids since 2020. Peanuts also had successful adaptations in theatre. with the stage musical You\'re a Good Man.

They are mainly soft-bodied. like octopuses. but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen. made of chitin.\\nSquid diverged from other cephalopods during the Jurassic and occupy a similar role to teleost fish as open water predators of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers. moving by jet propulsion. and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of invertebrates. with groups of Humboldt squid having been observed hunting cooperatively. They are preyed on by sharks. other fish. sea birds. seals and cetaceans. particularly sperm whales.\\nSquid can change colour for camouflage and signalling. Some species are bioluminescent. using their light for counter-illumination camouflage. while many species can eject a cloud of ink to distract predators.\\nSquid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan. the Mediterranean. the southwestern Atlantic. the eastern Pacific and elsewhere.

A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup. industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars. such as maltose. fructose and glucose.\\n\\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes). is sometimes added to commercially available processed food and beverages. and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year. with North and South Americans consuming up to 50 kg (110 lb) and Africans consuming under 20 kg (44 lb).As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century. researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar. especially refined sugar. was damaging to human health. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity. diabetes. cardiovascular disease. and tooth decay. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications. but with varying results. mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015. the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%. and encouraged a reduction to below 5%. of their total energy intake.'),(86,8,'Rice (Oryza Sativa)',500,'Kg','https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536304993881-ff6e9eefa2a6?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMzE2MDJ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxyaWNlfGVufDF8MHx8fDE2NTQwOTY5Mjc&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=400','Oryza sativa. commonly known as Asian rice. is the plant species most commonly referred to in English as rice.
